### Description

This backup manager makes syncing file systems across multiple drives and devices quick and simple. The user can create custom presets that make maintaining backups as easy as clicking a single button. Comparisons between folders can also be made to identify differences in their contents. The application has been made with Python with PyQt5 for the GUI.
